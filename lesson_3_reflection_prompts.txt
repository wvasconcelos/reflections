When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
A: A fork is a clone within Git Hub. It is used when you want to work on someone's project without disrupting the original project. A clone is a copy of a project locally. It is used to create versions of a project or for colaboration in a project. Branches are also created locally, to produce versions of a project.
