#git checkout <id>	: reverts to a previous version of the code.

When to make a commit? rule of thumb: whenever there is a logical change.
Write a short message explaining the logical change.

To use previous versions of your code, use:
#git checkout <commit hash>

To revert back to the head branch:
1. Find out which name of the head branch:
#git branch -v 
2. Revert to the original "head":
#git checkout <head branch name>
Note: the name may be "master".
