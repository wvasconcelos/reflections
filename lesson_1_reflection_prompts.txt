How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
A: Instead of comparing line-by-line, I was able to jump directly to lines
that had different content. In large files, it would be virtually impossible
to compare versions manually (or visually). 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
A: It would allow for the recovery of lines of code deleted previously.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
A: Pros include having control over relevant versions and prevent frivolous
and unecessary versions from being created. Cons include the risk of
forgetting to create a version and losing some important information.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
A: Git views the source code as a single unit (commit), and a commit may have many files.
Google Docs, on the other hand, views the document as the unit of concern.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
A: git log will show the ids of each commit while the git diff followed by those ids will show the differences or what has changed between those commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
A: The ability to reverse changes is a game changer!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
A: To clone the Braintree repository and start working on a new module for Zen Cart.
